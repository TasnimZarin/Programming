# 🧠 Programming Practice & Problem Solving

This repository showcases my programming and coding skills across various languages and domains.  
Here, you'll find my hands-on practice in:

- ✅ Algorithms and Data Structures  
- 🛠️ Operating Systems (OS) Concepts  
- 💡 Problem Solving in multiple languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++)  
- 📚 Conceptual implementations and mini projects  

The goal of this repository is to strengthen core programming foundations, explore different paradigms, and sharpen logical thinking.

> 🔍 Dive in to see how I break down problems, write clean code, and approach challenges from different angles.
